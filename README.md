# Practice

I love to constantly put my programming skills to work either by learning a new technology or by solving programming puzzles. 
In this repository you will find a little bit of both, each folder can be either the solutions to puzzles found on a specific website
or the name of a technology I am interested in and the code I've written using it.

Any feedback is appreciated.
